            <p>Johannesburg Lasts is a project that aims to think about residues, traces and the lastingness of the legacies that built the city. Conceptualised across a collective seven practitioners the project looks at xxxxx</p>

            <p>Nine projects tackle the idea of the last or the lasting or the lost through forms that push at and interrogate how Johannesburg lives on, but more importantly how the effects of Johannesburg’s birth ultimately affect contemporary life today. Some of the themes include securitization and surveillance, the stickiness of dust, narratives of mobility, histories of jazz, radioactive spirits and heaps of potential dust.</p>

                    <p class='biographyTitle'>Abstract:</p><p>‘You Have A Message!’</p> <p>What of Johannesburg’s many deaths – and what if these could speak? What ghosts would rise, what would they say about Johannesburg’s continuities – its political, economic, and ecological dormancies and relapses? Operating at a multitude of spatial layers, this project seeks to reveal unseen currents, seepages, damage and ecological alterations, emergent through Johannesburg’s mining landscapes. The project conjures a speculative imaginary, which attempts to simultaneously narrate both past and future, where lasting consequences of mining activities in Johannesburg become intertwined in the supernatural and economic.</p> <p>As similarly observed in mining remnants found to the west of the city, the imaginary begins with land-scale registers of ground-radioactivity in the Village Main mine area. Transfusing northward through groundwater, it reaches the roots of a nearby impepho plantation. Burning of the crop some weeks later produces a lasting augmented potency. The impepho’s effects exponentially flourish. A spiritual network metastasises – a frequency of millions of voices, messages, and invocations exponentially growing – accessible through a small portal in Jeppestown, Johannesburg. The project traces the speculative by-product economy of this spatial and temporal anomaly through Kholwa’s enterprise: a micro-radio station owner on the fringes of Kwa Mai Mai market. She has acquired the ability to tap into this supernatural communication network using a massive transistor radio that she has set up on the roof of her shop. Kholwa regularly holds programming of various selected contributions by people ‘on the other side’ of Johannesburg. There are several other network-channels like her in the area. Adverts of their offerings are pasted to every visible concrete bin, bollard or electrical distribution box in Johannesburg. The presence of Johannesburg and its connected deceased remains perpetual, continuous, lasting – a chaotic yet profound archive of trauma adjacent to everyday Jo’burg life.<br/> <br/>  </p>

                <p class='biographyTitle'>Abstract:</p><p>The Bantu Mens’ Social Centre</p> <p>From the mid 1920s, the Bantu Mens’ Social Centre (BMSC) served as a lively centre of cultural activity for black men – and some women – in Johannesburg, attracting and nurturing many outstanding intellectuals and artists. This piece revisits the site nearly a full century after its opening, foregrounding how practices of listening, aurality and their attendant ways of knowing have shaped public and private urban experiences. Though the BMSC was silenced as a site of musical sociability by apartheid, the piece reflects on the extent to which the city’s jazz cultures have sonic afterlives that extend across historical ruptures, even if they have travelled elsewhere. Presented here as a sound essay, the piece has been recorded being read aloud in the hall of the BMSC. The sounds of the author’s voice resonate in the space to which it refers, inscribing its contemporary sonic materiality in a reflection on what lasts of the BMSC, and also what has been lost. The spoken text (which can also be read in textual form) is accompanied by two other audio sources, each with their own spatiality and temporality: the ambient resonance of the hall, and a 1959 recording by local jazz icon Zakes Nkosi, named after the BMSC.<br/> <br/></p>

                <p class='biographyTitle'>Abstract:</p><p>Narratives Of Mobility</p> <p>Patriarchy, misogyny and their legacy has resulted in a pervasive culture that makes womxn feel unsafe in central Johannesburg. Womxn have had to find strategies of survival to allow them to navigate. These strategies entail personal mappings of routes and lines that allow womxn to move through the city. I will examine my journey of walking from the Gautrain Park Station to the Wits Art Museum, via Jorissen Street, using my experiences as a method to generate insight and knowledge. My research is underpinned by the idea of “theorising from the epicentres of our own agency”. I think through how womxn can use their personal, embodied experiences as a valid starting point from which knowledge can be produced. </p> <p>The title of this project contains two words that can function within a particular framework/reading. The first is “narrative” and the second is ‘navigate’. ‘Narrative’ is a retelling of an account of specific events that has taken place. Narrative becomes a method to capture experiences where each step functions as a proxy for memory. By presenting this project as a narrative, I make personal observations based on my own perceptions. I am aware that my experiences will be influenced by race and class as well as how my body is read by others. The word “navigate” draws attention to the inherent difficulty experienced in attempting to move from one place to the next as a Black womxn … and doing so safely.</p> <p>I am concerned with the idea of safety, or rather, perceptions of safety. For me, safety means the ability to complete the journey without incident. An incident can either be a verbal provocation (including but not limited to catcalling) and in extreme cases, may include a physical provocation such as mugging, (wo)manhandling and/or rape.<br/> <br/></p>

                <p class='biographyTitle'>Abstract:</p><p>Potential Heaps Of Dust</p> <p>There is nothing of particular significance to Springs. No landmarks of importance or stops worthwhile. Not unlike other small towns on the outskirts of Johannesburg, Springs was a supplier in the chain of natural resources and labour to the development of the big city. Coal, uranium, railways and power lines, slag heaps and tailings dams. Travelling along the N17 leaving Johannesburg, there is little geographical shift. Less trees, grasses to catch the dust, perhaps less to look at. The expanse is haunted with a thickness to the air, as punctuated as the sinkholes it all rests upon. Dissonant gaps in the series of photographs that follow are a result of an exchange of sorts between two friends wilfully ungluing a silly sense of identity. The identity of a place.</p> <p>What happens if you believe the stories you get told?<br/> <br/></p>

Through examples as varied as pollen, neutrinos, mine dust and the Saharan Dust Plume, the piece asks: how do we detect or sense these particles and what do they have to offer? How and where do they travel and what impact do they have on the humans and non-humans they interact with? Do particles have memory?<br/> <br/></p>

To this day, the cause of a fire at the Bank of Lisbon in September 2018, which lasted for 3 days and led to its implosion, has not been disclosed publicly. This despite a series of legal investigations implicating provincial government departments, city offices and the Johannesburg Emergency Services. The Bank of Lisbon housed various departments, including the Department of Health, when it started to burn. On the first day of the fire, three firemen lost their lives as they got trapped on the 23rd floor. It emerged that fire hydrants in the building were dry. Grievous issues of occupational health and safety were ignored for years, despite repeated complaints by office workers and labour unions. At the time of the fire, the building should not have been occupied as it did not meet basic compliance standards.</p> <p>This project consists of three parts that evolve around the unfolding narrative. It begins with a video recording of the implosion, filmed from the evacuated student residency directly opposite the Bank of Lisbon (a collaboration with Simon Gush and Andrei van Wyk). This is followed by a text that collates online information around the fire, sourced mainly from available news reports and interviews. The final part is a sound piece by Andrei van Wyk: a re-composition of the cameras’ audio recordings that proposes a sonic meditation on the collapse of architecture and a search for a vertical movement through a now imagined space. Between these instances is the attempt to think through Locard’s exchange principle, that ‘every contact leaves a trace’[1] and acknowledge the disparate presence of traces in the city’s nervous system that echo an alternate, socially legitimate reality. </p>

It uses two new office buildings in Johannesburg as suggestive (but not conclusive) illustrations in order to highlight how this new workplace set-up bolsters managerial control by blurring the distinction between work and life. At the same time, it projects an image of being more free and laidback. In the broader context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which is changing the world of work, we suggest that the greater white-collar shift to home-working represents the final colonization of work over life.<br/> <br/></p>
